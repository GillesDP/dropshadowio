## üëÄ About the project
It all started on the most ordinary day at the most usual time. I needed a way to generate drop shadows quickly for the web. After doing some research, I noticed there were quite a few tools out there already, but none of them seemed to fulfill my needs. That‚Äôs when I decided to create something fresh, with user usability in mind.

## üéì Experience
This was my first ever project built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Prior to this project I took a 10 hours long React course by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and finished over 20 hours of the JavaScript course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This project took **over 80 hours** to complete from which 20 hours were spent on the design and UX research. It goes without saying that this project has contributed enormously to personal development and experience.

**What I learned in this project:**
* Components with React (and everything that goes with it: passing Properties, using State, useEffect...)
* Mapping over arrays and objects to generate components
* Input validation
* Routing & Meta Data
* Getting a deeper look into Bootstrap components to create my own
* HTML naming conventions using BEM

## ‚úç Branding & Styleguide
This project required me to come up with a complete styleguide and branding. By doing this I am able to easily expand the project by adding consistent components in the future.
